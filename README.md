🐍 Python Snake Game Project 🎮

A classic Snake game built using Turtle graphics. 
Here's a brief overview of the project:

🟢 Features:

The game includes a snake that moves around the screen, controlled by arrow keys.
Randomly positioned food items appear for the snake to eat, increasing its length.
A scoreboard keeps track of the player's score as they eat food.
The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.

🚀 Technologies Used:

Python: Leveraged the Turtle graphics library for drawing graphics and handling user input.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: Implemented classes for the snake, food, and scoreboard to organize the code efficiently.
Event handling: Utilized Python's event-driven programming paradigm to capture user input for controlling the snake.
